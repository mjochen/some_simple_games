# My Mastermind

A version of mastermind that also filters in the background. Has a GUI in Python!

Todo:
v Add frames (cheating to the right)
- Change letters to colors
- Create/test new game
- Add double colors

- cheating:
    v colors ruled out
    v colors sure off
    - positions sure off

Update: should have made an API with a webinterface.
